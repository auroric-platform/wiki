# Spruce

The Region of Spruce is known for its deep harbor, mountainy landscape, and rich mineral deposit. These factors combined have led Spruce into an industrial and militarily important island.

## Attractions

Major attractions on the island include the former [Aurora Navy](../../../government/government-of-aurora/executive-branch/departments/safety-and-defense/defense-forces.md) Great Spruce Naval Base, the Spruce Hiking Trails, and the Royal Spruce Palace.&#x20;

## History

### Republic of Spruce

### Annexed by Aurora

Following the collapse of the Synercraft Network and [Watersuno](../../../other/worldview/concord-worldview/watersuno-dissolved.md), The Government of Spruce has activated its Emergency Transfer Protocol with the Government of Aurora, leading to its annexation on June 30, 2021. And since then, the Transitional Affairs Committee has been working hard to rebuild Spruce's infrastructure.
