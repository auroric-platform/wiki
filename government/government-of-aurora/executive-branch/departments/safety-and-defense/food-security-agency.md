# Food Security Agency

The Food Security Agency is one of the most secretive agencies under the Government of Aurora, where it monitors the Republic's food access and health situation.

## Responsibility

The Agency's primary responsibility consists of ensuring event food safety and managing the Aurora Food Security Association group chat.

### Event Food Safety

Ensuring food hygiene and safety is the founding goal of the Agency, and the Agency often got to pick a venue that matches the high standard of food taste for meetings.

### Managing [the Aurora Food Security Association](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]&#x20;

The Aurora Food Security Association is a foodie chat group, also known as 'A1', a Facebook Messenger group that the Agency manages. The Agency is responsible for verifying that culinary items posted on the group meet Aurora's high standard of food quality.&#x20;

## Culture Influence

The Food Security Agency is mostly seen as a meme in Aurora's culture, where Congress members often use food security topics as a filibuster.&#x20;

And as physical meetings of the Republic often occur in restaurants, food security often got picked up as a joke to remind participants about personal hygiene during dining.
