# Executive Orders
Executive Order is a directive by the President of the Republic of Aurora, which manages the operations of the government. Executive Order serves a constitutional role in Aurora's legal system and has become the essential framework of the Law of Aurora.

Although the President can sign a new executive order at any time in council with the National Security Council, this power is cautiously used to avoid the overriding the legislative power of the Collective Council.
